    <p>The chinchilla has the densest fur of all mammals that live on land.
    </p>
    <p>They live in colonies called "herds" at high elevations of up to 4,270 m (14,000 ft). <br>
        Historically, chinchillas lived in an area that included parts of Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, <br>
        and Chile, but today, colonies in the wild are known only in Chile.</p>
